# Adora Dark Dokuwiki Template#
`git clone git://github.com/notconscious/dokuwiki-template-adoradark.git`

A dark theme with orange and yellow trim based on the default template for the October 13 2012 release of Dokuwiki, codenamed "Adora Belle." The original was created by Dokuwiki guru [Anika Henke](http://github.com/selfthinker), and it has an interesting backstory, which you can read [here](http://blog.selfthinker.org/2012/10/20/the-story-behind-dokuwikis-new-template/). I really love the new design, so I changed the colors to my liking and tweaked the page widths to allow more text to fit on the screen. The header height is also modified because my site logo is shorter than the Dokuwiki logo. You can change the colors to suit your needs by editing **style.ini** or **style.local.ini**, but changing the layout will require delving into the **css** folder.

I tend to prefer dark themes for most things because they don't hurt my eyes so much. I've noticed only a few dark themes for Dokuwiki over the past few years, so I felt like contributing one to the community. Enjoy...
